# Photobook-Project-Server
This repo holds the code for the server side component of Photobook.
Photobook is my attempt of making a simple social media like app for uploading multiple images in this case called photobooks since you can upload multiple
photos like a photobook, you can like and comment them. The app is also equipped with a complete jwt authentication system.
you can find the app on the following link:
